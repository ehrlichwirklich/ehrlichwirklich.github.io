Librarian, computer scientist, artist are all roles that I have held, but none are all of me. I have always wanted a site that I could organize the professional and select personal aspects of my work and life to share with the world. The world in this case being the mostly [dead internet](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/silicon-psyche/202501/the-dead-internet-theory-why-being-online-feels-empty?msockid=155bd8f95644635723a8ce6d576862c1), but I digress. The main features will be my resume, writings, intermittent blogging and social links. I hope to make some public facing reading accounts for a glimpse into what I am currently reading.
